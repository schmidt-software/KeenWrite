# Typesetting

The application uses the [ConTeXt](https://contextgarden.net) typesetting
system, the [podman](https://podman.io/) container manager, various
[themes](https://gitlab.com/DaveJarvis/keenwrite-themes), and numerous
fonts to produce high-quality PDF files. The container manager significantly
reduces the number of manual steps in the installation process.

When exporting a document to a PDF file for the first time, a series of
semi-automated steps guides users through the installation process. These
steps differ depending on the operating system.

Run the installation wizard as follows:

1. Start the application.
1. Click **File → Export As → PDF**.

Follow the steps in the wizard to install the requisite software and
typesetting themes.
