# Internationalization

The application supports internationalization (I18N). There are multiple
components to editing and previewing internationalized text documents.
These include:

* Fonts
* Language

Both fonts and language must be set for non-Latin-based text.

# Fonts

The text editors and preview panel have independent font settings. For
all Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) fonts, you may have to type in
the font family name directly.

For example, CJK font families for the editor have the following names:

* **Noto Sans CJK KR** --- Korean font
* **Noto Sans CJK JP** --- Japanese font
* **Noto Sans CJK HN** --- Chinese font
* **Noto Sans CJK SC** --- Simplified Chinese font

While CJK font families for the preview have the following names:

* **Noto Serif CJK KR** --- Korean font
* **Noto Serif CJK JP** --- Japanese font
* **Noto Serif CJK HN** --- Chinese font
* **Noto Serif CJK SC** --- Simplified Chinese font
