        One humid afternoon during the harrowing heatwave of 2060, Renato
        Salvatierra, a man with blood sausage fingers and a footfall that
        silenced rooms, received a box at his police station. Taped to the
        box was a ransom note; within were his wife's eyes. By year's end,
        a supermax prison overflowed with felons, owing to Salvatierra's
        efforts to find his beloved. Soon after, he flipped profession into
        an entry-level land management position that, his wife insisted,
        would be, in her words, *infinitamente m√°s relajante*---infinitely
        more relaxing.
