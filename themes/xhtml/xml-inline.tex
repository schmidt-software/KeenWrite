% Underlines are undefined. Early typewriters used monospaced fonts that
% presented evenly-spaced characters, and had a limited character set. Such
% limitations were found in early computers, though the technological reasons
% differ. Italic text can be typeset more closely while retaining legibility
% at smaller sizes; in early printing, italics provided a way to set off
% sections of text. Typewriters and early computers didn't offer italics,
% and by 1881 the underscore key became a fixture to work around connecting
% text on machines that lacked italics.
